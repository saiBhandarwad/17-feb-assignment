    "accommodate massive scale, when you are rapidly prototyping, and a few other use cases.\n",
    "Lesser Server Cost and Open-Source NoSQL databases are cheap and open source. NoSQL database implementation is easy and typically uses cheap servers\n",
    "to manage the exploding data and transaction  while RDBMS databases are expensive and it uses big servers and storage systems.\n",
    "In comparison to the SQL server, MongoDB is faster and more scalable. While the SQL server supports JOIN and Global transactions, MongoDB does not. \n",
    "The MS SQL server does not accommodate large amounts of data, however MongoDB does.\n",
    "MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving \n",
    "data schemas. As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to \n",
    "store documents.\n",
    "If your data is very structured and ACID compliance is a must, SQL is a great choice. On the other hand, if your data requirements aren't clear or \n",

    "    MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of a mechanism known as sharding. Sharding refers to the process of distributing data on\n",

    "    across shards that reside across many physical servers. It can also add new machines to a running database."
